> This document describes console platform functionality that is no longer a part of our **[ecosystem roadmap](../ecosystem-roadmap.md)**. We do not recommend using this content in new products, but we will continue to support existing usages for the indefinite future. Our preferred modern solution focuses on **[virtual terminal sequences](../console-virtual-terminal-sequences.md)** for maximum compatibility in cross-platform scenarios. You can find more information about this design decision in our **[classic console vs. virtual terminal](../classic-vs-vt.md)** document.
