> [!TIP]
> This API is not recommended and does not have a `[virtual terminal](../console-virtual-terminal-sequences.md)` equivalent. This decision intentionally aligns the Windows platform with other operating systems where the individual client application is expected to remember its own drawn state for further manipulation. Applications remoting via cross-platform utilities and transports like SSH may not work as expected if using this API.
