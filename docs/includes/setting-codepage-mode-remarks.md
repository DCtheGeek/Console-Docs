This function uses either Unicode characters or 8-bit characters from the console's current code page. The console's code page defaults initially to the system's OEM code page. To change the console's code page, use the [**SetConsoleCP**](../setconsolecp.md) or [**SetConsoleOutputCP**](../setconsoleoutputcp.md) functions. Legacy consumers may also use the **chcp** or **mode con cp select=** commands, but it is not recommended for new development.
